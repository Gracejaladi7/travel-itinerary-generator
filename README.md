# travel-itinerary-generator
An AI-powered web application built with Streamlit and Google's Gemini AI that generates personalized travel itineraries based on destination and trip duration.
For this project, an external API key was required to access the Google Generative AI service. Please note that the key I used was temporary and has since been revoked. 
To run the project, you will need to obtain your own API key from the Google Cloud Console and set it in your environment variables.

AI Integration: Leverages the Gemini 1.5 Flash model for intelligent content generation.

Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit to provide a clean, user-friendly interface for inputting travel details.

Customization: Allows users to specify destination, number of days, and number of nights to receive a tailored schedule.

Python-Based: Developed entirely in Python for easy deployment and scalability.
